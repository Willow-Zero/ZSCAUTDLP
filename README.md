Zero's Super Cool And Useful To Do List Program is a to do list/calendar program. It has a text based UI, and is entirely tailored toward my own personal needs. Feel free to use it if you want to, but I dont promise high quality.


# How to use
Basically, opening it up will give a title screen and the controls at the bottom. select the view you want (currently the calendar is the only functional view), and explore! 

To add an event, use the event adding tool with `m`, keeping care to enter information accurately. it will be added to the calendar.

To add a task, use the task adding tool with `y`, and it wil be added to the task list.
